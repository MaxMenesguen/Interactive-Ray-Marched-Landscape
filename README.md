# Interactive Ray-Marched Landscape

Welcome to the **Interactive Ray-Marched Landscape** project! This is a simple yet visually captivating WebGL experience, showcasing a simple terrain generated using sine and cosine functions and various 3D shapes illuminated by a rotating light source. The scene creates a day-night-like effect as the light moves around the objects.

## Features
- **Ray-Marched Terrain and Shapes**: A terrain created using sine and cosine functions for rolling hills and a few 3D shapes like spheres, boxes, and a torus.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: A light source rotates around the objects, casting realistic shadows and creating a dynamic lighting effect.
- **User Interaction**:
  - **Camera Control**: Move the camera around the scene using your mouse on desktop or your finger on mobile devices.

## How to Use
- **Desktop**: Click and drag your mouse to rotate the camera and explore the scene.
- **Mobile**: Use your finger to drag across the screen and adjust the camera view.

## Technologies Used
- **WebGL** and **GLSL** for rendering and shading.
- **JavaScript** for handling user inputs and managing the rendering loop.

## Future Plans
- Add more complex terrain features, like water or vegetation.
- Introduce a sun and moon for a complete day-night cycle.
- Include interactive elements like clicking on shapes to change their properties.
